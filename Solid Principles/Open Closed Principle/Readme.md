The principle says “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”.
The key idea is that whenever new requirement comes, you should be able to introduce new functionality through extension rather than modifying existing code( as existing code is well tested and modifying it will open it for bugs)
