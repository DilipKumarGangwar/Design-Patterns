This is a simple implementation of the Observer Design Pattern in C++.

The Observer Design Pattern is a software design pattern that allows one-to-many relationships between objects. In this pattern, there is a subject (also called observable or publisher) and one or more observers (also called listeners or subscribers) that depend on the subject. When the subject's state changes, all the observers are notified automatically.

In this code, there are three main classes:

ISubscriber: This is the interface that all subscribers must implement. It has only one method notify which is called by the subject when a change occurs.

User: This class represents a user (or an observer) that subscribes to the subject. It implements the ISubscriber interface and has a unique id to differentiate between different users.

Group: This class represents the subject (or the publisher) which users can subscribe to. It has a list of subscribers (of type ISubscriber *) and provides methods to subscribe/unsubscribe users and notify them when a change occurs.

In the main function, a Group object is created, and three User objects subscribe to it. Then, the Group object notifies all the subscribers about a change. After that, one User object unsubscribes from the Group, and the Group notifies the remaining subscribers again.

Overall, this code demonstrates how the Observer Design Pattern can be used to implement a simple publish-subscribe mechanism.
